# GenAI-AgenticAI-MCP

The Generative AI (Gen AI), Agentic AI, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) syllabus typically progresses 
from foundational AI and prompt engineering to building autonomous, multi-agent systems using frameworks like LangChain and CrewAI, 
with a focus on tool use and collaboration via protocols like MCP. 

# Typical Syllabus Outline
## Section 1: Generative AI Foundations 
This section covers the core concepts of AI that form the basis for agentic systems: 
- Introduction to Gen AI and LLMs: Understanding what generative AI is, its applications, and how Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, and Llama work.
- Key Concepts: Transformers, attention mechanisms, embeddings, tokenization, and vector databases.
- Prompt Engineering: Techniques for effective prompting, including zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. 

## Section 2: Agentic AI Fundamentals
This section introduces the architecture and principles of AI agents: 
- Anatomy of an AI Agent: Core components including the LLM (brain), memory, tools, and planning/reasoning capabilities.
- Agentic Frameworks: Hands-on experience with popular frameworks such as LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, and AutoGen.
- Tool Use and Function Calling: Teaching agents how to interact with external tools, APIs, and real-world data (e.g., web search, databases). 

## Section 3: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- MCP is a key component for enabling reliable communication and interoperability between agents and tools: 
- MCP Fundamentals: Understanding the architecture, core concepts, and how it facilitates secure and reliable tool calling across different systems.
- MCP Implementation: Building end-to-end applications using MCP to connect agents with services like email, HR systems, or other APIs. 

## Section 4: Advanced Agentic Patterns & Applications
This section covers more complex use cases and system designs: 
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Agents: Integrating RAG to provide agents with up-to-date, specific context, reducing hallucinations.
- Multi-Agent Collaboration: Designing and orchestrating teams of agents with assigned roles and tasks to achieve complex goals.
- Multimodal Agents: Integrating vision, voice, and text capabilities into agents.
- Evaluation and Safety: Methods for testing, evaluating, and implementing guardrails for robust and ethical AI systems.
- Deployment: Steps for deploying agentic applications, often using cloud services like Hugging Face Spaces or AWS.
